        "notes": "Collision with the border is essentially moving within range of it while being targetable, including via normal movement, dash, or displacement.\nAurora and enemies can collide with the border any number of times, as much as the duration permits.\nSince the borders apply a  displacement upon collision, enemies that  dash or are displaced through the borders will be automatically interrupted.\nEnemies that can resist the displacement from colliding with the border will be able to leave the rift's zone.\nThis includes enemies that are  displacement immune or  immune to all crowd control, or have a  spell shield.\nIf Aurora or enemies are  attached to a unit, they can be moved outside of the rift by the unit they are attached to, even after colliding with the border.\nThe displacement upon collision with the border will not have any effect on targets that are being attached to another unit.\n Untargetable units cannot collide with the border, including Aurora herself.\n Blinks with a destination outside of the rift will not collide with the border and thus will ignore the range check.\nThe in-game tooltip claims that the rift lasts for 3 / 3.25 / 3.5 / 3.75 / 4 seconds which is incorrect.(bug)\nThis duration seems to count the time it takes for the pulse to fully expand. However, the rift and its borders will only form after the fact, so the actual duration of the rift is the values in the tooltip minus 0.75 seconds each rank.\nThe rift will close immediately if Aurora is not within the area when the pulse fully expands.\nIf Aurora  dies or enters  resurrection, or otherwise manages to escape the rift after it has formed, the rift is closed immediately.\nBetween Worlds'   untargetability from the rift dash does not  destroy in-flight  projectiles.\nBetween Worlds'  first cast is disabled while  grounded or  rooted.\nAurora can still dash from colliding with the border even if she is  immobilized or  grounded.\n Spell shield can block both the initial pulse and the knock back and slow from colliding with the border.\nA pair of portals signifying Aurora's nearest possible entry and its corresponding exit is visible to her at all times.\nThe following table refers for interactions while Aurora is dashing:\nThis lockout applies to both the initial dash and the dashes in the rift.\nThe lockout during the initial cast's dash persists for another 0.5 seconds after the dash ends.\nThe lockout during the rift dash persists for another 0.15 seconds after the dash ends.\n\n\nAttacking\n\nDisabled\n\n\nAbilities\n\nDisabled\n\n\nMovement\n\nDisabled\n\n\nItems\n\nUsable\n\nN/A\n\n\nDisabled\n\nAll items are disabled\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nConsumables\n\nDisabled\n\n\nSpells\n\nUsable\n\n Barrier  Clarity  Cleanse  Exhaust  Ghost  Heal  Ignite  Smite\n\n\nDisabled\n\n Flash  Teleport  Recall  Hexflash\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nN/A\n\n\nInterrupted by\n\nDeath",
