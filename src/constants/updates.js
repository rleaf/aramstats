         `I've been calling it a lot of things, but I'm talking about the page when you click 'Champions' in the nav bar. In this update I'll be calling it the Champions List Page. A little verbose, but it's not really a "Tierlist" and calling it the "Champions" page sounds too similar to "Champion" page which is the page when you search a champion.`,
         `I've redesigned the Champions List Page to show data that provides more quantitative metrics for champions. Specifically, I've (so far) added the sample mean and standard deviation for damage per minute, damage taken per minute, self mitigated damage per minute, and gold per minute. A potential drawback however is, because I'm multiprocessing, I am using the sum of squares method to compute these moments versus something more ideal like the Welford method; sum of squares is known to be numerically unstable when working with big ass numbers. With my current rate limit & speeds I don't *believe* I will encounter these issues, however I'll be keeping an eye out for them.`,
         `Some things tentative about the page currently:`,
         `1. Patch selection. I may remove this to be conservative with hardware.`,
         `2. Data Vis. I originally planned to add eye candy by showing gaussians for all the stats. Since I'm already computing the parameters for them I figured "why not?". After thinking about it more however, I'm not confident enough in the sampled distributions to assume them gaussian - and so the eye candy is on the back burner until I test for normality.`,
         `3. Datums. The four datums (DPM, DTPM, SMPM, and GPM) are pretty specific, and depending on interpretation, *too* specific. For instance, enchanter heavy players are left behind with no information on ally healing per minute and a lot of tanks have healing built into their kits, but there's no healing per minute. I do plan to add these specific stats (AHPM & HPM), but I want to start small and gradually increase. I am thinking of neato stats outside of the "per minute" domain as well.`,

      body: [
         `As mentioned in the previous update, I will be keeping an eye out for bugs - this is primarily for testing. This update breaks down into two significant updates: a new Summoner page UI and a backend redesign.`,
         `This new Summoner Page UI, while I hope more enjoyable to interact with, is functionally much more capable. Rendered stats are computed from selected champions provided in the table. Instead of being limited to viewing things like damage, shielding, and healing on one particular champion, you can now see aggregated stats for any set of champions. Along with the increased customizability, there're also loads more stats to view. Be sure to hover the tooltips for more info of the corresponding stat.`,
         `The backend redesign seeks to resolve a couple of issues with the largest being "frozen summoners". Occasionally, because of hardware constraints, bad code, or a combination of the both, a summoner will be "frozen" or "stuck" stating they're currently being parsed when that account's actually in limbo. I've added more logic and error handling to hopefully prevent these issues. This update is geared heavily towards the summoner UI redesign so although I've reduced the chances of a summoner being frozen, I've not yet implemented logic to "intelligibly unfreeze" them. Currently, if a summoner is detected to be frozen, you will be will have to re-parse them entirely.`,

I plan to add more so that people can cater the displayed data to their preferences.`,

"Builds" focuses on allowing users to filter through observed builds by distributing items to the slot in which they were purchased. Users can click on any item in any slot and view all combinations of items (and winrate) which correspond to some observed build.
         Individual Items shows data about a particular item. Currently it shows slot popularity: the frequency by slot in which that item is purchased, and encounters: observed friendly and enemy champion encounters where that item was purchased. I will probably remove/change the latter.`,

Because of the limited amount of storage, I designed the backend to be "picky" when pulling game data from Riot's servers and only store specific information. It was a decent solution for the free tier, but since upgrading to the Pi (pic below), I can be more liberal with hoarding data which in turn may allow me to provide more stats.`,

This started because I wanted to see my performance on certain champs and to try and convince some friends, using empirical data, that maybe Aurelion Sol is just not for them or taking Glacial Augment on Azir deserves a ban. As more people use this site, I'd like to revamp the backend to ameliorate UX and try and make it more efficient so it crashes less.`,
