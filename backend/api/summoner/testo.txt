PARSE SUMMONER ORDER
   1. User types in Summoner, presses enter
   2. User is prompted if they're sure they want to lookup their summoner (gatekeeps missclicks/accidents, etc...). User hits yes.
   3. Api routes to appropiate summoner endpoint:
      1. Lookup summoner to see if they exist (no point in wasting compute on DNE summoners). If DNE, return error / break
      2. Search for summoner (via puuid) in DB. If summ exists, aggregate & return summ
      3. If summ DNE in database, but exists, add puuid to Queue.

   4. If summoner puuid is in Queue, return summoner position in Queue and Queue length.


QUEUE FUNCTIONALITY
   1. On each summoner lookup, also fire Queue.
   2. Queue will maintain state where if it's true when fired from step 1, nothing will happen, and if it's false, it will begin firing/working on the puuids in the Queue.
   3. Once the Queue length is zero, the state will be set to false, indicating the Queue is inactive.
